# HomeReadingBookDistributionApp

A simple JavaFX app to help home reading book distribution among students. 
You can create/edit/delete classes and students. 
Distribute books in a way that no student will get to read the same book twice
and no two students will get the same book on the same week (presuming that there 
is only one copy of each book).
